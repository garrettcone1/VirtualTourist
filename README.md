# VirtualTourist

This app is a fun way to be your own tourist and travel the world virtually through pictures. 

### How to Use
1. Download the app onto your Desktop, and open the Virtual Tourist.xcodeproj
2. Click the Run button in the upper left corner
3. When the map loads, go ahead and press and hold anywhere in the map
4. When a pin has been placed, click on the pin to find photos that are nearby that location
5. In this collection view, if there are any photos that you wouldn't like saved, you can click on them to delete them
6. Click the New Collection button to load more images based on the pin's location
